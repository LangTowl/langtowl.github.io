                        A Prettier Wordle is clone of the popular New York Times game Wordle. It functions in nearly the same way, one five 
                        letter word is chosen from a list of 2317, and users have six guesses to figure out what the word is. After each guess 
                        the game board and keyboard change colors indicating if a letter is in the correct spot, present but in the wrong spot, 
                        or is not present in the word. I did my best to give this clone a modern twist with a more attractive UI, while still preserving 
                        the core functionality of the game. 

                    <br><br>

                    This clone was created using Apple's Swift language and their SwiftUI API. The complete project can be found on my GitHub with the link below.

                    trainers in the fitness industry. The app allows users to build a library of workouts that can be used to

                    workout consistency, successful lifts, and packages it in a user-friendly way to help users reach progressive

                        This Verilog project was conducted in parallel with my Digital Logic Design course at university.
                        The goal was to program a functional military-style stop-watch entirely from Verilog. The code was
                        written and compiled using Quartus Prime before being uploaded to an FPGA for testing. The watches
                        functionality was limited to a start, stop, and restart controls. The watch could count anywhere 
                        from 1 minute to 1 hour. 

                        <br> <br>

                        The functionality of the watch was achieved by creating several Verilog modules such as a half and 
                        full adder, a ripple carry adder, a BCD controller, clock divider, D and T flip-flop, 4-bit register, 
                        and the LCD controller. The complete code can be found at the link to my GitHub below.

                        Project T.Y. (The Youth) was an initiative led by myself and 
                    several other youth ambassadors for Parley for the Oceans. Our 
                    goal was to produce a seven-episode documentary series that follows 
                    young athletes and activists from different indigenous communities 
                    around that Pacific. The series would pair exhilarating big wave surfing content, 
                    with actionable solutions to climate and pollution issues pioneered by these young 
                    activists. 

                    <br> <br>

	                Viewers at home would follow along as each episode is focused on a different community
                    in the pacific, highlighting the impacts of climate change and pollution. Episodes would
                    conclude with steps viewers can take at home to participate in cleaner living, and how they 
                    can get involved in their own communities.

                    <br> <br>

                    Unfortunately, Project T.Y. was indefinetly put on hold due to the pandemic and travel restrictions in the region of interest.

                        This project began when schools transitioned to online, and classes were 
                        being held virtually. When I found out I was going to be spending a lot 
                        more time at home, I decided to optimize my setup by designing a fully function 
                        mechanical keyboard using open-source components. The goal was to have different 
                        layers of functionality depending on the software or app being used.
    
                        <br> <br>
    
                        The PCB was designed using Autodesk’s Eagle CAD. THT components like diodes, 
                        resistors, switches, and other components were soldered to the board by 
                        hand. The microprocessor used to control the PCB was an Arduino Micro driven by an 
                        ATMEGA32-U4 chip. The software was written in Arduino’s modified C++ language.

                        Manta Fin Co. was a small startup that I worked on creating. The 
                        goal was to design and manufacture high performance surfboard fins 
                        out of upcycled ocean plastics and distribute them to local shops in the Northeast. I had designed a fleet of several fins 
                        ranging from 3-fin thruster set ups, 4-fin quad setups, 2-fin twin setups, 
                        and a few longboard single fins. 
    
                        <br> <br>
    
                        Each design was calibrated using the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 
                        airfoil database. The fins were modeled using Fusion 360’s surface modeling before being 
                        tested in SolidWork’s simulation engine. They would then be prototyped using either 3D 
                        printing or CNC milling, before being tested in the ocean.

                        Manta Fin Co. was nearly ready for launch, we had begun the process of filing for an L.L.C 
                        and were working on setting up contracts with local surf shops. It was at this point when the 
                        cost of manufacturing using injection molding became inaccessible, so Manta Fin Co. had to be put on hold indefinetly.
