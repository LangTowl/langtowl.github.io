                I grew up surfing year-round in the frigid waters of Maine and 
                New England. Living on this pristine coast fostered a deep respect for 
                nature and marine ecosystems on which our modern world depends. 
                This connection to the ocean inspired my interest in the engineering 
                skills that would allow me to participate in innovations focused on 
                its protection.

                I am seeking an entry level computer engineering position where I can 
                apply skills in software development, hardware design, and environmental
                conservation to innovate solutions to pressing climate issues. I aspire 
                to collaborate within a design team working on consumer electric vehicles 
                that inspire people to explore the outdoors without contributing to their 
                decline.

                I am currently a second semester sophomore studying Computer Engineering at 
                Florida Polytechnic University in Lakeland Florida. This ABET accredited degree 
                is concentrated in electric and autonomous vehicles. Topics in this program include
                 computer vision systems for vehicles localization, control and motion planning, 
                 software and hardware architectures for autonomous driving, vehicle dynamics, 
                 and modeling/control for electric motors and hybrid vehicles.
