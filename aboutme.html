                I grew up surfing year-round in the frigid waters of Maine and New England. 
                Living on this pristine coast fostered a deep respect for nature and the marine 
                ecosystems on which our modern world depends. This connection to the ocean inspired 
                me to pursue a STEM education to one day apply these skills to initiatives focus on 
                environmental preservation.

                <br> <br>

                While I still care deeply about the ocean, my interests have evolved into different 
                STEM applications. I have always been fascinated by difficult technical problems and 
                the bright minds who solve them. Few industries have to solve more complex problems than 
                the aerospace and defense industry. I aspire to work within a team of engineers tackling 
                such problems, allowing me to grow my skills in software 
                development, hardware design, and sustainability.
